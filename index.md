DARERL revolutionizes medical device manufacturing by offering digital representations of human anatomies for computerized design and clinical testing.

Developing and testing new medical devices traditionally involves costly and time-consuming incremental tests of physical prototypes. These tests carry a high risk of delays or unsuccessful regulatory approval. In the conventional approach, each prototype must be built and tested sequentially in the real world, with each experiment needing to be completed before the next can begin. DARERL transforms this process for our customers.

Our virtual solution enables testing on large populations of digital human models, bypassing real-world bottlenecks and providing enhanced statistical analysis.

By utilizing DARERL's computerized design and testing approach, our customers enjoy several benefits:

- **Reduced Time-to-Market:** Virtual testing can be conducted in parallel, speeding up the development process.
- **Minimized Waste and Animal Testing:** The need for physical prototypes is reduced, cutting down on material waste and eliminating the ethical concerns associated with animal testing.
- **Enhanced Safety in High-Risk Scenarios:** Testing can be performed without endangering real humans, thereby avoiding the need for ethical approval.
- **Accelerated Regulatory Approval:** Comprehensive population statistics and sensitivity analysis support faster and more reliable regulatory approval.
