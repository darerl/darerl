DARERL provides computer models and computing services to medical device manufactures which will enable them to include variation of humans in their computerised testing and development of their products. The core idea behind the DARERL product is to provide access to a portfolio of multiple foundational mechanistic models for virtual development and testing. This is different from current industry practice of using a single generic foundational model. DARERLs competitive advantage is in-house software for faster automated upscaling of the number of models compared to any existing approaches and software for doing the statical analysis on large collections of models. DARERL moves industry from single in-silico case study to the next level of full in-silico clinical trials. DARERL takes advantage of large medical image data set, expert knowledge of anatomical geometry in neural networks, finite element analysis, and statistical population analysis.

DARERL ApS was founded as a spin-out company activity from University of Copenhagen by Professor
Kenny Erleben and Professor Sune Darkner. The company was in relation to the EU RIA
project, [Intelligent Robotic Endoscopes for Improved Healthcare Services (IRE)](https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/how-to-participate/org-details/999999999/project/101135082/program/43108390/details) funded under HORIZON-CL4-2023-DIGITAL-EMERGING-01. 

The technology innovation behond DARERL was originally developed under the Horizon 2020 project [RAINBOW](https://rainbow.ku.dk/) that ended in 31/03/2022. The [European Commission Innnovation Radar analysed](https://innovation-radar.ec.europa.eu/innovation/35799) this innovation based on data collected on 11/11/2019. The innovation was assessed by the JRCâ€™s Market Creation Potential indicator framework as addressing the needs of existing markets and existing customers. 

Early versions of the DARERL Digital Twin Technology was applied to [orthodontics](https://di.ku.dk/english/news/2024/straightening-teeth-ai-can-help/) and [orthopedic](https://di.ku.dk/english/news/2022/diku-creates-digital-twins-of-the-future/) use cases. Our technology has created some of the highest quality public available digital populations [LibHip](https://github.com/diku-dk/libhip) and [Open-Full-Jaw](https://github.com/diku-dk/Open-Full-Jaw). Since 2019 the technology has matured and as of 2024 can handle more cases such as [virtual kidneys](https://github.com/diku-dk/RenalVesselSeg) and [colons](https://ire4health.eu).
