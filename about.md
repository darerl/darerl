DARERL provides computer models and computing services to medical device manufactures which will enable them to include variation of humans in their computerised testing and development of their products. The core idea behind the DARERL product is to provide access to a portfolio of multiple foundational mechanistic models for virtual development and testing. This is different from current industry practice of using a single generic foundational model. DARERLs competitive advantage is in-house software for faster automated upscaling of the number of models compared to any existing approaches and software for doing the statical analysis on large collections of models. DARERL moves industry from single in-silico case study to the next level of full in-silico clinical trials. DARERL takes advantage of large medical image data set, expert knowledge of anatomical geometry in neural networks, finite element analysis, and statistical population analysis.
