DARERL provides computer models and computing services to medical device manufacturers, enabling them to incorporate human variation in their computerized testing and development processes. The core idea behind DARERL's product is to offer access to a portfolio of multiple foundational mechanistic models for virtual development and testing, a departure from the industry's current practice of using a single generic model. DARERL's competitive advantage lies in its in-house software, which allows for faster automated upscaling of models and statistical analysis on large collections of models. This innovation moves the industry from single in-silico case studies to comprehensive in-silico clinical trials. DARERL leverages extensive medical image datasets, expert knowledge of anatomical geometry in neural networks, finite element analysis, and statistical population analysis.

DARERL ApS was founded as a start-out company from Professor Kenny Erleben and Professor Sune Darkner from the University of Copenhagen.
The company emerged in connection with the EU RIA project, [Intelligent Robotic Endoscopes for Improved Healthcare Services (IRE)](https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/how-to-participate/org-details/999999999/project/101135082/program/43108390/details), funded under HORIZON-CL4-2023-DIGITAL-EMERGING-01.

The technology behind DARERL was originally published
and open-sourced under the Horizon 2020 project [RAINBOW](https://rainbow.ku.dk/),
which concluded on 31/03/2022.
The [European Commission Innovation Radar](https://innovation-radar.ec.europa.eu/innovation/35799) analyzed this innovation based on data
collected on 11/11/2019.
The JRCâ€™s Market Creation Potential indicator framework assessed the innovation
as addressing the needs of existing markets and customers.

Early versions of DARERL's Digital Twin Technology were applied to [orthodontics](https://di.ku.dk/english/news/2024/straightening-teeth-ai-can-help/) and [orthopedic](https://di.ku.dk/english/news/2022/diku-creates-digital-twins-of-the-future/) use cases.
Our technology has produced some of the highest quality publicly available digital populations, such as [LibHip](https://github.com/diku-dk/libhip) and [Open-Full-Jaw](https://github.com/diku-dk/Open-Full-Jaw). 
Since 2019, the technology has matured, and as of 2024, it can handle more cases, including [virtual kidneys](https://github.com/diku-dk/RenalVesselSeg) and [colons](https://ire4health.eu).
