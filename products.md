Subscribe to our extensive database of digital twins representing human body anatomies.

The variation in human anatomy is vast, making design and testing on a single virtual human model inadequate for generalization. Medical devices must function effectively across diverse human anatomies, necessitating thorough testing to ensure consistent performance. 

Let DARERL assist you in simulating not just one, but 100 or even 1,000 virtual human models. This approach provides causality and statistical significance for development, testing, and approval processes.

- **Control and Select Test Populations:** Choose from a diverse range of virtual human models.
- **Verified Models for Simulation:** Access models that are verified for accurate simulation.
- **Clinically Validated Models:** Utilize models that have undergone rigorous clinical validation.
- **Updated Anatomical Models:** Benefit from the latest advancements in virtual human anatomy technology.

DARERL manages the entire process, from acquiring scan data and segmenting anatomies to meshing and verifying simulation capabilities. This allows our customers to focus solely on testing their medical devices on our digital populations.

<h2>Pilot Studies</h2>

At DARERL, we collaborate with our customers to perform pilot studies that test the feasibility of new anatomies not yet included in our portfolio. Our services are tailored to meet our customers' specific needs, which may include data acquisition of medical images, model generation, simulation, or post-analysis with statistical tools. DARERL has the expertise to support customers through the entire process of utilizing digital twin populations for virtual testing of medical devices.

<h3>Models</h3> 
Our in-house software tools enable efficient creation of computational finite element meshes for precise anatomical modeling of multi-tissue cases.
