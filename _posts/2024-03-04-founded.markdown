DARERL ApS was founded as a spin-out company activity from University of Copenhagen by Professor
Kenny Erleben and Professor Sune Darkner. The company was in relation to the EU RIA
project, [Intelligent Robotic Endoscopes for Improved Healthcare Services (IRE)](https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/how-to-participate/org-details/999999999/project/101135082/program/43108390/details) funded under HORIZON-CL4-2023-DIGITAL-EMERGING-01. 

The technology innovation behond DARERL was originally developed under the Horizon 2020 project [RAINBOW](https://rainbow.ku.dk/) that ended in 31/03/2022. The [European Commission Innnovation Radar analysed](https://innovation-radar.ec.europa.eu/innovation/35799) this innovation based on data collected on 11/11/2019. The innovation was assessed by the JRCâ€™s Market Creation Potential indicator framework as addressing the needs of existing markets and existing customers. 

Early versions of the DARERL Digital Twin Technology was applied to [orthodontics](https://di.ku.dk/english/news/2024/straightening-teeth-ai-can-help/) and [orthopedic](https://di.ku.dk/english/news/2022/diku-creates-digital-twins-of-the-future/) use cases. Our technology has created some of the highest quality public available digital populations [LibHip](https://github.com/diku-dk/libhip) and [Open-Full-Jaw](https://github.com/diku-dk/Open-Full-Jaw). Since 2019 the technology has matured and as of 2024 can handle more cases such as [virtual kidneys](https://github.com/diku-dk/RenalVesselSeg) and [colons](ire4health.eu).
